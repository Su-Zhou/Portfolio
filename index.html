 <h2 id="About-Me">About Me</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is <b>Susane Zhou</b>, but I go by the online alias <b>Kusuri</b> for my digital artworks. 
        I am a student currently attending SAIT for the Interactive Design program with a specialization in UX/UI.
        I am mostly used to being an artist rather than a designer or problem solver so this education will be a unique experience throughouht my career journey. 
        In my free time is when I like to make fanart of my favourite anime characters/video game characters or my favourite Virtual Youtubers.
        I also have begun to dive a bit into video editing using Davinci Resolve and now Adobe After Effects.</p>

    <h3>My Hobbies & Interest</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><u>Piano/Music</u></dt>
            <dd>I have been playing piano for 10+ years. I also have dipped my toes into playing trumept for band, and a bit of guitar 
                during junior high.
                I'm pretty open to most music genres but I do have a preference to Jpop, J-Rock, Symphonic Rock, Musical-esque songs and especially 
                Video Game soundtracks. Some of my favourite-

            <dt><u>Video Games</u></dt>
            <dd>I grew up playing and being surrouded by JRPGs rather than other video game genres. Some of my favourite franchises
                include: NieR:Automata, Nier:Replicant, Persona 3 & 4, the Tales of Series, the Trails series and Final Fantasy. I would
                talk about more, but the list could be endless at this rate!
